# MoveSmarter
This is a cool app, users could enter the address 
where they want to move and get an idea of what 
the area would be like, get a street view,new york 
times news, and wikipedias artice. This project 
utilized jQuery framwork, especailly$.ajax and 
$.getJason. Also used google streetview API, 
New York Times API, and Wikipedia API. Thanks 
for the help of Cameron Pittman.
